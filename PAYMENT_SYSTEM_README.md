# BeluTales Payment System

## Overview
The BeluTales app now includes a permanent premium unlock system that saves user payments to a JSON file and automatically unlocks premium access for returning users.

## How It Works

### 1. Payment Storage
- When a PayPal payment is successfully completed, the buyer's email is extracted from the PayPal response
- The email and premium status are saved to `payments.json` file
- This creates a permanent record of premium users

### 2. Automatic Premium Unlock
- On app startup, the system checks `payments.json` for any users with premium access
- If premium users are found, the app automatically unlocks premium features
- Users don't need to pay again on subsequent visits

### 3. UI Updates
- When premium is active, the PayPal button is hidden
- A "ðŸ’Ž Premium Active" banner is displayed at the top
- All premium stories and features are unlocked

## Files Modified

### `app.py`
- Added payment helper functions: `load_payments()`, `save_payment()`, `check_premium_from_payments()`
- Updated PayPal capture to extract buyer email and save payment
- Added startup check to auto-unlock premium for returning users
- Enhanced success messages to show buyer email

### `payments.json` (Auto-generated)
- Stores user email addresses and their premium status
- Format: `{"email@example.com": {"premium": true}}`
- Created automatically when first payment is made

## Key Features

âœ… **Permanent Storage**: Premium unlocks persist across app restarts
âœ… **Email Tracking**: Each payment is linked to the buyer's PayPal email
âœ… **Automatic Unlock**: Returning premium users get instant access
âœ… **Safe & Simple**: Uses JSON file storage (no database required)
âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if file operations fail
âœ… **No Breaking Changes**: All existing features remain intact

## Usage

1. **First Time Users**: Click "Pay with PayPal" â†’ Complete payment â†’ Premium unlocked
2. **Returning Users**: App automatically detects premium status and unlocks features
3. **Premium Users**: See "ðŸ’Ž Premium Active" banner and have access to all stories

## Technical Details

- **Storage**: JSON file (`payments.json`) in app root directory
- **Email Extraction**: From PayPal capture response `payer.email_address`
- **Startup Check**: Runs on every app initialization
- **Session State**: `st.session_state["premium"]` controls UI behavior
- **Error Handling**: Continues working even if payment file is corrupted

## Security Notes

- Payment verification still requires PayPal backend confirmation
- Email addresses are stored locally (consider encryption for production)
- No sensitive payment data is stored (only email and premium status)
- PayPal handles all actual payment processing securely

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication system
- Implement payment expiration dates
- Add admin panel for payment management
- Encrypt stored payment data
- Add payment history tracking
